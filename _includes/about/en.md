This is me.
And this is my spot. 
In an ever-changing world, this is a single point of consistency.

—— Dylan, the tunafish-observer

I translate, I watch, I can't stop wondering.
I code, I design, I never settle.
I hate myself, I'm narcissistic, I'm condescending.

Now, I'm trying to decide my core drive.
