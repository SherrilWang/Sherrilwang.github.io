Dearest Creator, this is Sherril. A carbon-based creature that can read the Holy Code and is now trying to get in touch with you by this blog.

Since I lost the product manual attached to the package, I have to figure out the product description of me on my own.

If you have a copy of that manual, please send it to this address —— Shop 404, level 24601, St. Blahblahblah, I-don't-know-what-the-fuck-this-planet-is planet.

—— You Know Who

Engaged in music, engaged in other things, and I do everything.
Willing to collect, but never to sort.
As for what the hell I am... Who knows?

~~By the way, I'm using Google Translate.~~
