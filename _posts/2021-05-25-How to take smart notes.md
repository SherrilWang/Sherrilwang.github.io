# Background

Invented by Niklas Luhemann, the slip box method introduces a set of work flow that helps people keep record of their understanding and thoughts in a structured and permanent way.

The method is also called "Zettelkasten", and with the assistance of this method, he achieved significant results.


> “In 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, translations not included. Many became classics in their respective fields. Even after his death, about half a dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion, education or politics were published in his name – based on almost finished manuscripts lying around in his office. There are more than a few colleagues I know who would give a lot to be as productive in their whole lifetime as Luhmann was after his death.”

# How to implement

## The tool Box
* Four tools are required for implementing this system:
* Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do)
* A reference management system (e.g. Zotero)
* The slip-box (Recommended: Daniel Lüdecke’s Zettelkasten)
* An editor (e.g. word)


## Index system
Luhmann himself has two slip boxes, which are bibliographical one and main one. And he did not organize the notes by topics directly, but giving each unique number. 

> “If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. By alternating numbers and letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branch out into as many strings of thought as he liked. For example, a note about causality and systems theory carried the number 21/3d7a7 following a note with the number 21/3d7a6.”


An alternative method without using slashes is:


> 第一条笔记的地址为数字1。如果你想添加一个与第一条笔记无关的笔记，那么将新笔记的地址设为数字2。如果你想写一条与笔记1有关的新笔记，那么你应该以笔记1为起点产生一条分支，此时新笔记的地址被设为1a。如果还有一条与笔记1相关而与笔记1a关系不大的笔记，那么这条新笔记的地址应该被设为1b。如果你想对笔记1a进行补充或评论，那么你应该创建一个地址为1a1的笔记。所以，简而言之，当你继续一个思路时，新笔记地址的应该在旧笔记的的地址最后一位上递增，比如从1a递增到1b；当你想扩充或评论一条笔记时，那么你应该在该笔记的地址后添加一个新的字符，比如从1a到1a1。要实现这样的编号系统，你需要交替使用数字的字母。

## Writing a paper step by step

*How to Take Smart Notes* introduces the steps of writing a paper by making three types of notes.


1. Make fleeting notes.
This type of note is written forthwith and thrown away right after you put everything together. Use anything by your hand.
   
2. Make literature notes.
This is about the content of what you read. Note that be selective with quotes. This constructs your reference system.

3. Make permanent notes.
The core of our note taking process. Develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
> “Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible”

4. Add your new permanent notes to the slip box by:
*  a) Filing each one behind one or more related notes.
*  b) Adding links to related notes.
*  c) Making sure you will be able to find this note later by _either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point_ to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.

5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. 
Look into the slip-box to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters.

6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.
Leave some time for testing ideas, go back to reading and not-taking to improve them.

7. Turn your notes into a rough draft.

8. Edit and proofread your manuscript. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder and turn to the next manuscript.


## Notes and Links
**Types of notes**
1. Fleeting notes
2. Permanent notes
3. Project notes
* comments in the manuscript
* collections of project-related literature
* outlines
* snippets of drafts
* reminders
* to-do lists
* the draft itself

Wrong moves🙅
* Write down everything
* Only collect ideas related to specific projects
 
 
\
**Feedback loop**
* By writing down, we test our understanding. By writing down things, we remove it from our brain.

\ 
**Four types of links**
1. Links that give you overview of a topic
    * You can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic
2. Links that connect note-to-note
    * Simply connect notes 



## Structure Note

> 一个卡片盒笔记系统不应该只有通过笔记卡片和它们的联系由下而上建立的网状笔记，一些层次结构(hierarchical structure)也是非常有用的，卢曼自己也引入了类似的结构。

> 结构化笔记是元笔记(Meta-Note)：它是一个关于其他笔记及其联系的笔记。卢曼的枢纽笔记作为快速通道，可在笔记网络中导航。结构化笔记的作用也是如此。比如，上图是一个关于卡片盒笔记法的结构化笔记。它类似于一个目录(table of contents)，专门列出了所有有关这个主题的笔记。每当我写一个关于卡片盒笔记法的新笔记时，我都会将它的 ID 添加到这个结构化笔记上。

> 总结：关于其他笔记之间关系的笔记称为结构化笔记(Structure Note)。创建结构化笔记能够训练你发现通用知识模式的能力，能够从 卡片盒笔记系统发现结构化的有用信息供你未来使用。
