# Background

Invented by Niklas Luhemann, the slip box method introduces a set of work flow that helps people keep a record of their understanding and thoughts in a structured and permanent way.

The method is also called "Zettelkasten", and with the assistance of this method, he achieved significant results.


> “In 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, translations not included. Many became classics in their respective fields. Even after his death, about half a dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion, education or politics were published in his name – based on almost finished manuscripts lying around in his office. There are more than a few colleagues I know who would give a lot to be as productive in their whole lifetime as Luhmann was after his death.”

# How to implement

## Index system
Luhmann himself has two slip boxes, which are bibliographical one and main one. And he did not organize the notes by topics directly, but giving each unique number. 

> “If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. By alternating numbers and letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branch out into as many strings of thought as he liked. For example, a note about causality and systems theory carried the number 21/3d7a7 following a note with the number 21/3d7a6.”


An alternative method without using slashes is:


> 第一条笔记的地址为数字1。如果你想添加一个与第一条笔记无关的笔记，那么将新笔记的地址设为数字2。如果你想写一条与笔记1有关的新笔记，那么你应该以笔记1为起点产生一条分支，此时新笔记的地址被设为1a。如果还有一条与笔记1相关而与笔记1a关系不大的笔记，那么这条新笔记的地址应该被设为1b。如果你想对笔记1a进行补充或评论，那么你应该创建一个地址为1a1的笔记。所以，简而言之，当你继续一个思路时，新笔记地址的应该在旧笔记的的地址最后一位上递增，比如从1a递增到1b；当你想扩充或评论一条笔记时，那么你应该在该笔记的地址后添加一个新的字符，比如从1a到1a1。要实现这样的编号系统，你需要交替使用数字的字母。

## Writing a paper step by step

*How to Take Smart Notes* introduces the steps of writing a paper by making three types of notes.


1. Make fleeting notes.
This type of note is written forthwith and thrown away right after you put everything together. Use anything by your hand.
   
2. Make literature notes.
This is about the content of what you read. Note that be selective with quotes. This constructs your reference system.

3. Make permanent notes.
The core of our note taking process. Develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
> “Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible”
