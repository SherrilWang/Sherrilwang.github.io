### SMALL
[Application information for SMALL 2019:
June 10  – August 9, 2019](https://math.williams.edu/small/application-information/)  

[Research Publications](https://math.williams.edu/small/small-research-publications/)  

**Deadline** February 6, 2019  

Please apply online at http://www.mathprograms.org/db (it will be listed under Williams College as SMALL_REU); you can look at the required Application Form through the following links: (pdf: SMALLApplicationDoc or word file: SMALLApplicationDoc)   

During off hours, students enjoy the many attractions of summer in the Berkshires:  hiking, biking, plays, concerts, etc. Weekly lunches, teas, and casual sporting events bring SMALL students together with faculty and other students spending the summer doing research at Williams College. Participating students receive a stipend of about $4000. Several board plans are available at reasonable rates, with housing included for free. There are funds to help with travel to/from SMALL, as well as to support students to go to conferences to present their work. Students are required to live on campus to participate in the SMALL program.  Having students live together on campus allows for the mathematical interaction to expand beyond the boundaries of the workday.  


### Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) 2020

数学建模。我是从大三开始投入数学建模的，到现在研究生毕业，每年都参加。我想我们是应用数学专业的，参加数学建模比赛是很有意义的。而且，说实话性价比很高。你基本上辛苦3-5天就有可能获得省市一级或者全国的奖项，对于将来就业是很有帮助的。还有美国大学生数学建模比赛，我只参加过一次（那时候大四了，自费去的，后来也只拿了个二等奖）。我觉得这些都是既具有可操作性，又具有一定的含金量的活动。不过也许和你的想法有出入，因为这个算不上是“科研项目”。然而，对于你“想要丰富自己的知识应用能力”的想法是很有帮助的。  

对小分支的深入研究。我在本科的时候就发现即使是数学分析，高等代数，常微分方程这样的看上去十分古典的课程中也包含着大量值得探讨的课题。也许，这些问题不是数学发展的主流，也不是特别的重要和困难，但却十分有趣。我看到很多专业期刊上的论文实际上只比教材往前迈出了一步，或者两步，所以我觉得，如果你打算好好研究的话也是可以的。我那时候比较感兴趣的方向有：计算一些特殊的行列式及其推广、计算一些特殊的积分（你可以用到一些数学分析的方法，或者用到留数定理）、一些简单的不等式的推广，包括一些涉及凸性，单调性的问题。这些小方向都不是很具有理论深度的问题，但是的确需要一些好的智慧的火花。如果能够证明一些有意思的结果，然后找个国外期刊（不用太高端，质量中等就行）投稿。无论最终接收与否（初次投稿还是不太容易中的），我相信对你的学术经历都是一种丰富。当然，如果有老师愿意指导你的话，那就更好了。
