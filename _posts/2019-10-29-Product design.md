# ML
[Mahalonobis Distance](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/statistics/mahalanobis-distance/)

Measures the distance between a point and a distribution

1. It transforms the columns into uncorrelated variables
2. Scale the columns to make their variance equal to 1
3. Finally, it calculates the Euclidean distance.

```where, 
 - D^2        is the square of the Mahalanobis distance. 
 - x          is the vector of the observation (row in a dataset), 
 - m          is the vector of mean values of independent variables (mean of each column), 
 - C^(-1)     is the inverse covariance matrix of independent variables.
```
